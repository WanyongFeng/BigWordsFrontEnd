# BigWords Front-End

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing Dependencies and Running Project

In your terminal or command line at the root of the project run:

 `yarn install`

 This will install required packages.

 When finished, you can run the project with:

 `yarn start`

 This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
 Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

 The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
 You will also see any lint errors in the console.

 Also, `yarn build` will create a production build. But the project we have for you right now is a collection of game demos.

 ## Note on Functionality:

 The front-end makes calls to the back-end project. Run the back-end project in addition to the front-end.
